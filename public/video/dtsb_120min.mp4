# DOXY THE SCHOOL BULLY - COMPLETE 120-MINUTE SCRIPT
## Four-Act Structure with Extended Character Development

---

## **ACT I: THE SETUP (0-30 minutes)**

### **SCENE 1: DRAMATIC OPENING - DRONE SHOT & BULLYING INCIDENT (8 minutes)**

**EXT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - AERIAL SHOT - MORNING**

A sweeping drone shot reveals the imposing brick building of Westview High School, nestled in a suburban neighborhood. The camera descends from the sky, passing over students walking through the entrance, backpacks slung over shoulders, conversations audible as the shot gets closer.

**VOICEOVER (ETHAN)**
*(calm, introspective)*
This is Westview High. A place where futures are supposed to be shaped, friendships forged, and dreams realized. But for some of us, it's a place of fear.

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS**

Students stream through the hallway. The camera follows ETHAN (15), a thoughtful-looking teenager with kind eyes, as he walks nervously toward his locker. He keeps his head down, trying not to draw attention.

**ETHAN (CONT'D)**
*(continuing voiceover)*
Three years here, and I still feel like I'm walking on eggshells every day.

ETHAN reaches his locker, quickly putting in the combination. DOXY (16), a stocky, imposing teenager with sharp eyes, approaches with his friends.

**DOXY**
*(loud, taunting)*
Well, well, well. If it isn't Mr. Smart Guy with his head in the books again.

DOXY shoves ETHAN lightly against the locker. ETHAN tenses up, trying to stay calm.

**ETHAN**
Just trying to get to class, Doxy.

**DOXY**
*(getting closer, intimidating)*
You think you're so much better than us, don't you? All this reading, this studying. Trying to make the rest of us look bad.

ETHAN shakes his head, trying to de-escalate.

**ETHAN**
No, I just... I like learning. That's all.

**DOXY'S FRIEND**
He probably thinks he's gonna be valedictorian or something.

DOXY laughs meanly. Other students start to gather, some looking uncomfortable, others enjoying the spectacle.

**DOXY**
*(to the crowd)*
You know what they call Ethan in the hallways? 'Teacher's Pet.' 'Hall Monitor.' 'The Kid Who Never Fails.'

ETHAN's face reddens, but he tries to stay composed.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
*(approaching even closer)*
You know what I think? I think you're fake. I think all that good behavior is just an act. I think underneath, you're just like the rest of us - weak and pathetic.

ETHAN finally looks up, meeting DOXY's eyes with surprising strength.

**ETHAN**
Just because you can't see my strength doesn't mean it isn't there.

This catches DOXY off guard. For a moment, DOXY hesitates, uncertain how to respond.

**DOXY'S FRIEND**
*(nudging DOXY)*
Come on, Doxy. Don't let him talk to you like that.

DOXY regains his composure, but something has shifted.

**DOXY**
That's right, Ethan. Keep that attitude. See where it gets you.

DOXY and his friends walk away. ETHAN stands alone by his locker, trying to process what just happened. LILY (15), an energetic girl with warm eyes and a confident posture, approaches.

**LILY**
You okay? That didn't look comfortable.

**ETHAN**
*(trying to downplay it)*
I'm fine. Just... same old story.

**LILY**
It's not fine. What he did wasn't okay.

ETHAN looks at her gratefully but sadly.

**ETHAN**
I wish I was brave enough to stand up to him like you just did.

**LILY**
You have more courage than you think. It takes real strength to stay kind when people aren't kind to you.

ETHAN nods, but doesn't fully believe it.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

---

### **SCENE 2: CHARACTER BACKSTORIES - A DAY IN THE LIFE (10 minutes)**

**MONTAGE - ETHAN'S MORNING**

- ETHAN at home, quietly eating breakfast while his parents argue in the background about money
- ETHAN getting ready, looking in the mirror and practicing confidence that he doesn't feel
- ETHAN walking to school alone, through a neighborhood that feels isolating

**MONTAGE - DOXY'S MORNING**

- DOXY getting ready in a messy room, avoiding his father who's drunk on the couch
- DOXY grabbing a quick breakfast and leaving before the conversation can start
- DOXY arriving at school early, trying to outrun his home problems

**MONTAGE - LILY'S MORNING**

- LILY in a warm, loving family, laughing with her siblings at breakfast
- LILY helping her younger brother with his homework
- LILY walking to school, waving to neighbors and clearly comfortable with herself

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - VARIOUS CLASSROOMS - DAY**

Quick cuts of each character in different classes:

- ETHAN in English class, participating thoughtfully but keeping his head down
- DOXY in Math class, finishing assignments early and then distracting other students
- LILY in History class, leading a discussion about civil rights

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LUNCH**

ETHAN sits alone at a corner table, eating lunch and reading. DOXY's group of friends dominates the center of the canteen, laughing loudly and being disruptive.

LILY approaches ETHAN.

**LILY**
Mind if I sit with you?

**ETHAN**
*(surprised)*
Sure, I guess. You don't have to.

**LILY**
I want to. It's not natural to eat alone when there are people everywhere.

They sit together comfortably. Through the window of conversation, we see ETHAN's relief at having a friend.

**LILY (CONT'D)**
So, what are you reading?

**ETHAN**
*(showing her the book)*
"Harry Potter." I know it might seem silly for a high schooler, but...

**LILY**
*(interrupting)*
Harry Potter isn't silly. It's about hope, friendship, and standing up against injustice. Pretty relevant to our school.

ETHAN smiles, surprised by her understanding.

**ETHAN**
I never thought about it that way.

**LILY**
Sometimes it takes someone else's perspective to see what you already have inside you.

In the background, we see DOXY watching this interaction, but looking confused rather than angry.

---

### **SCENE 3: BUILDING TENSION - ESCALATING BULLYING (7 minutes)**

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - AFTERNOON**

ETHAN is studying for a major history test. The library is quiet and peaceful. DOXY enters, looking for a place to sit. The library is nearly empty except for ETHAN and a few other students.

DOXY spots ETHAN and walks over, clearly intending to cause trouble.

**DOXY**
Well, look who's hiding in the library again.

ETHAN looks up, trying to stay calm.

**ETHAN**
Just studying, Doxy. We have a test tomorrow.

**DOXY**
*(leaning over ETHAN's book)*
What is this? World History? You trying to show off how much you know about the past?

**ETHAN**
I just want to do well on the test.

**DOXY**
*(louder, not caring about library rules)*
You know what your problem is, Ethan? You think you're better than everyone else. You think because you get good grades, because you read books, that you're better than us.

ETHAN closes his book, but stays seated.

**ETHAN**
I don't think I'm better than anyone, Doxy. I just want to learn and do well.

**DOXY**
*(getting more aggressive)*
But you do think you're better. I see it in the way you look at us. The way you hold your head up when we're around.

The librarian looks over, but doesn't intervene. Other students are starting to notice.

**ETHAN**
That's not true. I'm just... I don't know what you want from me.

**DOXY**
I want you to stop pretending you're perfect. I want you to stop making the rest of us look bad just by existing.

DOXY knocks ETHAN's books off the table. ETHAN picks them up quietly, trying to maintain his dignity.

**ETHAN**
Why does it matter to you so much how I behave?

**DOXY**
Because it does! Because when you act like you're so much better than everyone else, you make the rest of us feel small.

This reveals something deeper in DOXY - a vulnerability masked by aggression.

**LILY**
*(approaching from another table)*
Actually, making people feel small is what you're doing right now, Doxy.

DOXY turns to see LILY standing there, clearly having heard the whole conversation.

**DOXY**
This is between me and Ethan. It's got nothing to do with you.

**LILY**
It has everything to do with me. We're all in this school together, and what you do affects all of us.

DOXY looks between LILY and ETHAN, suddenly feeling outnumbered and exposed.

**DOXY**
Fine. Whatever. Have your little study group.

He storms off, but not before adding:

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
*(over his shoulder)*
But he's still fake, and you all know it.

ETHAN looks down at his books, dejected. LILY sits down across from him.

**LILY**
You know that's not true, right?

**ETHAN**
I don't know anymore. Maybe I am fake. Maybe I'm just trying too hard to be good when everyone else seems to just... fit in.

**LILY**
You fit in with me. And if you can't see that, then maybe you need to see yourself the way others see you.

**ETHAN**
How do others see me?

**LILY**
As someone who's kind even when it's hard. As someone who cares about learning and doing the right thing. As someone who has real strength, even if you don't always feel it.

ETHAN processes this, but still looks uncertain.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

---

### **SCENE 4: THE PIVOTING MOMENT - ANNOUNCEMENT OF ASSEMBLY (5 minutes)**

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - NEXT MORNING**

Students gather around a posted announcement on the bulletin board. ETHAN approaches to read it.

**ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.)**
"Bullying Prevention Assembly - Thursday, March 15th. All students required to attend. Guest speakers and student testimonials will be shared."

ETHAN reads this with growing interest and concern.

**ETHAN**
*(to himself)*
Student testimonials?

LILY approaches and reads over his shoulder.

**LILY**
That could be interesting. Maybe even important.

**ETHAN**
*(nervous)*
Do you think they would actually ask students to talk about... personal stuff?

**LILY**
Maybe. If the school is really serious about addressing bullying.

ETHAN looks thoughtful, but also nervous. In the background, we see DOXY reading the announcement as well, but his expression is different - he's looking at it with something like apprehension.

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ (50s, serious but caring) sits at her desk. MS. JOHNSON, the school counselor (30s, warm and approachable), sits across from her.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
I think this assembly is a good step, but I want to make sure we do it right. We need real student voices, not just adult perspectives.

**MS. JOHNSON**
I agree. I've been working with a few students who have experienced bullying firsthand, and I think their stories could have real impact.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
Do you think any of them would be willing to speak publicly?

**MS. JOHNSON**
I have one student in mind - Ethan. He's been through a lot, but he's also incredibly thoughtful and brave. I think his perspective could be powerful.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
And what about students who might be doing the bullying? We need to make sure this isn't just about victims telling their stories.

**MS. JOHNSON**
I think if we approach it right, some students might surprise us. Sometimes the people who seem to be causing problems are actually dealing with their own issues.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
Let's see how this assembly goes. If it generates real conversation and change, we might be on to something significant.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

---

## **ACT II-A: THE AWAKENING (30-55 minutes)**

### **SCENE 5: THE ASSEMBLY - ETHAN'S SPEECH (20 minutes)**

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY**

The entire school body fills the auditorium. Students file in, talking quietly. The stage is set with a podium, several chairs, and a backdrop. PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ, MS. JOHNSON, and other faculty members sit on the stage.

The camera focuses on the three main characters as they find their seats:
- ETHAN in the middle section, looking nervous and uncertain
- DOXY in the back, arms crossed, trying to appear indifferent
- LILY in the front, alert and supportive

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
*(approaching the microphone)*
Good morning, Westview High. Thank you all for being here today.

The room becomes quiet. Murmurs fade to silence.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ (CONT'D)**
Today, we're here to talk about something that affects every single person in this room - bullying and how we can create a safer, more supportive environment for everyone.

The camera pans across the audience, showing various reactions - some students looking interested, others uncomfortable, some bored.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ (CONT'D)**
Bullying isn't just about physical aggression. It can be name-calling, exclusion, intimidation, and creating an atmosphere where people feel unsafe or unwelcome. And it happens more often than any of us want to admit.

She pauses, letting this sink in.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ (CONT'D)**
Today, we have some guest speakers, and we're also going to hear from some of you - our students - who have something important to say.

MS. JOHNSON stands and approaches the microphone.

**MS. JOHNSON**
Thank you for being here. This isn't about getting anyone in trouble. This is about understanding, growth, and making our school a place where everyone can thrive.

She looks out at the audience, her eyes finding ETHAN.

**MS. JOHNSON (CONT'D)**
Sometimes the most powerful voice is the one that comes from the heart. Today, we have a student who has found the courage to share his story, hoping it will help others understand the real impact of bullying.

ETHAN's breathing becomes more visible. DOXY suddenly looks alert, sensing where this is going.

**MS. JOHNSON (CONT'D)**
Ethan, would you like to share your story with us?

A moment of silence. Every eye in the auditorium turns to ETHAN. He stands slowly, his legs visibly shaking. LILY gives him an encouraging nod.

**ETHAN**
*(approaching the microphone, voice trembling)*
Hi... I'm Ethan. And I want to talk about something that's been happening to me at this school.

He stops, looking out at the sea of faces. The silence is almost overwhelming.

**ETHAN (CONT'D)**
*(continuing, gaining a little strength)*
For months, I've been coming to school afraid. Not afraid of tests or presentations - afraid of other students. Afraid of being mocked, humiliated, made to feel worthless.

The auditorium is completely silent now. Even the air conditioning seems quieter.

**ETHAN (CONT'D)**
It started with mean comments, then exclusion from groups, and eventually... physical intimidation. Every day, I would wake up hoping I could just get through the day without being targeted.

The camera focuses on DOXY in the audience. His confident posture has shifted. He looks uncomfortable, maybe even disturbed.

**ETHAN (CONT'D)**
But the worst part wasn't the bullying itself. It was feeling like nobody cared. Like I was invisible. Like my pain didn't matter to anyone.

ETHAN's voice grows stronger, more confident.

**ETHAN (CONT'D)**
I want to say something to anyone who might be doing this to others - or to anyone who sees it happening and doesn't speak up. You have power. You have a voice. And using that voice to hurt someone else doesn't make you strong - it makes you someone who has forgotten what empathy feels like.

ETHAN looks directly at DOXY for a moment, then continues.

**ETHAN (CONT'D)**
I know change is possible. I've seen it in myself - finding the courage to speak up today. And I believe it can happen for others too. We all deserve to feel safe, valued, and respected in this school.

ETHAN sits down. The auditorium erupts in applause. The camera shows various reactions:
- Students wiping tears
- LILY beaming with pride
- DOXY sitting frozen, staring ahead with a shocked expression

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
*(taking the microphone back)*
Thank you, Ethan. That took incredible bravery.

More applause. ETHAN looks overwhelmed but relieved.

**MS. JOHNSON**
Now, I'd like to open this up to questions and discussion. If you have something to say, if you need clarification, or if you have your own story to share, this is a safe space.

The room buzzes with quiet conversation. The assembly is clearly having an impact.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

---

### **SCENE 6: IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH - CONVERSATIONS (15 minutes)**

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER**

Students file out of the assembly hall, talking animatedly. The conversation has clearly affected everyone. DOXY stands alone by his locker, looking lost in thought. LILY approaches him deliberately.

**LILY**
Hey, Doxy. Mind if I talk to you for a minute?

DOXY looks surprised that she's speaking to him after what he just witnessed.

**DOXY**
Uh... sure. I guess.

They walk to a quieter area of the hallway, away from other students.

**LILY**
What did you think about Ethan's speech?

DOXY shifts uncomfortably, not making eye contact.

**DOXY**
It was... intense. I didn't realize it was that bad for him.

**LILY**
What do you mean by that?

**DOXY**
I mean... I guess I thought it was just normal school stuff. You know, kids being kids. I didn't think about what it might actually feel like for him.

LILY studies his face carefully, looking for genuine confusion vs. deflection.

**LILY**
Doxy, can I ask you something? Do you actually see how your actions affect other people?

DOXY looks away, trying to avoid the question.

**DOXY**
I... I don't really think about it that much. I just do what feels natural at the time.

**LILY**
What if I told you that your actions are causing someone to wake up every morning afraid to come to school?

This hits DOXY differently than he expected. His face changes as he processes this.

**DOXY**
(quietly)
I never thought about it that way. I was just... I don't know. Trying to fit in? Looking tough?

**LILY**
Ethan said something about finding courage to speak up today. That took incredible bravery. He was scared, but he still did it because he believes change is possible.

DOXY looks at LILY with new understanding, but also uncertainty.

**DOXY**
Do you think... do you think I could change?

**LILY**
I think anyone can change if they really want to. The question is - do you want to? Not just to stop getting in trouble, but because you genuinely want to be better?

DOXY considers this seriously.

**DOXY**
I don't want to be the person people are afraid of anymore. I just... I don't know how to be different.

**LILY**
We can figure that out together. But you have to really want to try.

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS**

ETHAN sits across from MS. JOHNSON, looking both relieved and nervous.

**MS. JOHNSON**
How are you feeling after that?

**ETHAN**
I'm glad I did it, but also kind of... exposed? Like everyone now knows my business.

**MS. JOHNSON**
That's normal. Vulnerability often feels that way initially, but it's also where real connection happens.

**ETHAN**
Do you think it will actually change anything? Or will things go back to normal tomorrow?

**MS. JOHNSON**
That depends. Change is a process, not a single event. It starts with awareness, then requires commitment and action.

**ETHAN**
And what if people don't want to change?

**MS. JOHNSON**
Then we keep creating environments where change becomes easier than staying the same.

ETHAN nods, understanding but still uncertain about what comes next.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

---

## **ACT II-B: THE STRUGGLE (55-80 minutes)**

### **SCENE 7: DOXY'S INTERNAL STRUGGLE (10 minutes)**

**INT. DOXY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT**

The room is messy - clothes on the floor, books scattered, an unmade bed. DOXY sits on his bed, staring at his phone. The screen shows messages from various school groups, some involving gossip and mean comments about other students.

He scrolls through his recent messages:
- "Ethan is such a teacher's pet"
- "Did you see how he answered that question in history class? So annoying"
- "Ethan thinks he's better than everyone"

DOXY stops scrolling. He looks at these messages as if seeing them for the first time. He puts the phone down and puts his head in his hands.

**DOXY**
(voiceover, quiet and troubled)
All this time, I thought I was just... being me. Making sure people knew I wasn't weak. Making sure I fit in with the right crowd.

He looks up at himself in the mirror across the room.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
(continuing voiceover)
But what if... what if I was just being a bully? What if all those times I thought I was being tough, I was actually being cruel?

The weight of realization hits him hard.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
(continuing voiceover, more distressed)
He was afraid to come to school. Because of me. Because of things I said and did.

DOXY stands and walks to the mirror, really looking at himself.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
What kind of person am I? What kind of person hurts someone just to make themselves feel better?

He touches his reflection slightly, as if he barely recognizes the person looking back at him.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
I have to fix this. I have to make this right.

But then doubt creeps in.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
(continuing voiceover)
But how do you fix something like this? How do you undo months of being cruel?

He sits back on his bed, staring at his phone. After a long moment, he deletes the mean messages one by one.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

---

### **SCENE 8: THE CANTEEN CONFRONTATION - LILY CONFRONTS DOXY (25 minutes)**

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - CANTEEN - LUNCH TIME**

The canteen is bustling with students. The atmosphere has changed subtly since the assembly - there's a different energy, more awareness, but also tension. Long tables filled with teenagers eating, talking, and navigating the new social landscape.

DOXY sits alone at a corner table, picking at his food. He looks lost in thought, occasionally glancing around the canteen. ETHAN approaches with his lunch tray, clearly nervous but determined.

**ETHAN**
Mind if I sit here? I wanted to talk to you about something.

DOXY looks up, surprised. This wasn't what he expected.

**DOXY**
Uh... sure. I guess.

ETHAN sits down across from him, setting his tray aside.

**ETHAN (CONT'D)**
I know we've had our... issues. And I wanted to tell you something directly.

DOXY sets down his food, paying full attention.

**ETHAN (CONT'D)**
Every time you would call me names, exclude me, or make me feel worthless, it wasn't just a moment for you. For me, it was hours, sometimes days of feeling like I didn't belong anywhere.

DOXY opens his mouth to respond, but ETHAN continues.

**ETHAN (CONT'D)**
I'm not here to make you feel bad. I'm here because I believe you can be better than this. I believe people can change, but they need to understand the impact of their actions first.

DOXY looks genuinely affected, his usual defensive posture softening.

**DOXY**
Ethan, I... I didn't realize it was that bad. I thought it was just normal... I don't know, school stuff.

**ETHAN**
Here's the thing, Doxy. It might have been "normal" to you, but it wasn't normal for me. Every day, I would sit in class wondering if you were going to embarrass me in front of everyone. I would avoid certain hallways just hoping I wouldn't run into you.

The canteen is getting quieter as other students notice the conversation. Some are watching, others are pretending not to listen.

**ETHAN (CONT'D)**
But today, in the assembly, I found my voice. And I want to help you find yours too - but using it to build people up, not tear them down.

DOXY looks around, realizing other students are listening. His instinct is to deflect, but something holds him back.

**DOXY**
(lowly)
I don't know how to fix this, Ethan. I don't know if it's even possible.

LILY approaches the table with her lunch tray.

**LILY**
Can I join this conversation?

Both boys nod. She sits down, positioning herself so she can see both of them.

**LILY (CONT'D)**
The first step to fixing something is understanding the problem. Doxy, what did Ethan's speech mean to you?

DOXY takes a deep breath, clearly struggling with the vulnerability required to answer honestly.

**DOXY**
It made me realize... that I haven't been thinking about other people at all. I've been so focused on making sure nobody thought I was weak, that I became the one who was actually being weak - by picking on people who couldn't fight back.

ETHAN looks surprised by this admission, but also cautiously hopeful.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
I was wrong. I'm sorry, Ethan. I can't take back what I did, but I want to be better. I want to prove that I can change.

**ETHAN**
I appreciate you saying that. But changing isn't just about saying sorry. It's about doing things differently, day after day.

**DOXY**
I know. And I'm ready to try. I just... I need to learn how.

**LILY**
That's what we're all here for - to help each other learn and grow.

LILY addresses the whole table, but looks directly at DOXY.

**LILY (CONT'D)**
But Doxy, I need to ask you something. Why do you do it? What do you get out of being mean to people?

DOXY considers this carefully, his guards dropping further.

**DOXY**
I... I guess I never really thought about it that way. I just thought that's what you had to do to fit in. To be accepted. To make sure people knew you weren't someone they could push around.

**ETHAN**
What if I told you that people respect kindness much more than cruelty?

**DOXY**
I don't know. I've never tried being kind.

**LILY**
Well, here's your chance. We all make mistakes, Doxy. What matters is what we do after we realize we've made them.

The three sit in comfortable silence for a moment, the canteen gradually returning to its normal volume around them.

**DOXY**
Will you... will you help me? I don't want to mess this up.

**ETHAN**
I will, but you have to really want to change. Not just because you're in trouble, but because you want to be better.

**DOXY**
I do. I really do.

**LILY**
Then we start today. One kind action at a time.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

---

### **SCENE 9: THE LEARNING PROCESS - SMALL CHANGES (10 minutes)**

**MONTAGE - DOXY'S ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE (One Week Later)**

- DOXY helping a struggling student with their locker combination
- DOXY quietly moving to a different table when he sees someone eating alone, making space for them
- DOXY holding the door for other students instead of letting it slam
- DOXY stopping mid-sentence when he realizes he's about to make a sarcastic comment
- DOXY actually listening when a student shares something in class
- DOXY smiling genuinely when complimented on his work

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY**

DOXY approaches ETHAN, who is looking for a book in his locker.

**DOXY**
Hey Ethan. How's it going?

**ETHAN**
(cautious but not hostile)
Good. How are you?

**DOXY**
I've been thinking about what you said. About how actions matter more than words.

**ETHAN**
That's good. It's not easy to change patterns you've had for a while.

**DOXY**
It really isn't. Yesterday, I almost made a comment to Jake in history class, but I caught myself. I asked if he needed help instead.

**ETHAN**
That's a good first step.

**DOXY**
It felt... weird. Different. But not bad different. Like, I actually felt better about myself afterward.

**ETHAN**
Yeah, kindness tends to have that effect.

DOXY nods, then hesitates before asking his next question.

**DOXY**
Can I ask you something? About before?

**ETHAN**
Shoot.

**DOXY**
What were you most afraid of? When I was... when I was being mean to you?

ETHAN considers this, then answers honestly.

**ETHAN**
The worst part was thinking that this was just who you were. That you'd never change. That I'd have to deal with it forever.

**DOXY**
I'm sorry you felt that way. I want you to know that I'm not giving up on trying to be better.

**ETHAN**
I can see that. And I appreciate it.

DOXY looks relieved to have been heard.

**LILY**
*(approaching)*
What are we talking about?

**DOXY**
Just about change. How hard it is, but how good it feels when it works.

**LILY**
That's a good observation. Change is difficult, but it's also the only way to grow.

**ETHAN**
And sometimes you need people to believe in you while you're learning how to believe in yourself.

They all nod, understanding the complex journey they're embarking on together.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

## **ACT III: THE TRANSFORMATION (80-120 minutes)**

### **SCENE 10: SETBACKS AND GROWTH (15 minutes)**

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY**

DOXY walks with a new group of students who are being kind and inclusive. But as they pass a group of his old friends, one of them makes a comment.

**DOXY'S OLD FRIEND**
Well, look who's gone soft. I heard you were helping people with their homework now.

DOXY stops, clearly conflicted. The new group waits for him to respond. He has a choice to make.

**DOXY**
*(to his old friend)*
Yeah, I am. And it's made me a better person.

**DOXY'S OLD FRIEND**
*(scoffing)*
Whatever, man. Don't come crying to us when people start walking all over you.

The old friend walks away. DOXY turns back to the new group, looking uncertain.

**NEW FRIEND**
You okay? That guy seemed upset.

**DOXY**
I'm fine. I just... I guess I'm learning that not everyone will understand when you change.

**LILY**
*(approaching from behind)*
That's part of growing up. You have to choose who you want to be, even when other people don't like it.

**DOXY**
But what if I mess up? What if I fall back into old patterns?

**ETHAN**
Then you admit it, you apologize, and you try again. That's what growth looks like.

**DOXY**
It seems so simple when you say it.

**LILY**
Sometimes the simple truths are the hardest to live by.

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY**

In history class, a new student, MARIA (15), sits alone, looking lost and confused. The teacher asks if anyone can help her get caught up on the material.

DOXY looks around. No one else volunteers. He raises his hand.

**DOXY**
I can help her, if that's okay.

**TEACHER**
That would be wonderful, Doxy. Thank you.

The camera focuses on ETHAN and LILY, who exchange approving glances.

After class, DOXY approaches MARIA.

**DOXY**
Hey, I'm Doxy. Mind if I help you with the history work?

**MARIA**
(pleased but surprised)
That would be really helpful. I'm Maria, by the way. I'm new here, and I don't know many people yet.

**DOXY**
Well, now you know me. And I'm happy to help.

**MARIA**
Why are you offering to help? You don't even know me.

DOXY considers this question seriously.

**DOXY**
Because I know what it feels like to feel lost and alone in a new place. And because helping other people feels good.

**MARIA**
That's really kind. Thank you.

As they walk toward the library to study together, the camera shows DOXY's genuine smile - different from his old, sarcastic smirk. This is real happiness.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

### **SCENE 11: FULL CIRCLE - DOXY'S OWN SPEECH (20 minutes)**

**MONTAGE - DOXY'S CONTINUED GROWTH (Several Weeks Later)**

- DOXY organizing a study group for struggling students
- DOXY standing up for a freshman who was being picked on
- DOXY having lunch with a diverse group of students
- DOXY volunteering to help in the school office
- DOXY genuinely listening to his teachers and participating in class

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ and DOXY sit across from each other. The principal looks impressed and supportive.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
Doxy, I wanted to talk to you about something. I've been hearing a lot of positive feedback about you recently.

**DOXY**
(nervous)
Good feedback?

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
Yes. Students are saying you've been helping them, standing up for people, and just generally being a positive presence in the school.

**DOXY**
I've been trying to be better. To make up for... for before.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
I think what you're doing now is much more important than whatever came before. I have a proposition for you.

DOXY listens carefully.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ (CONT'D)**
We're having another assembly next month - not about bullying, but about personal growth and transformation. I'd like to ask you to speak.

**DOXY**
(panicking)
Me? Speak in front of the whole school? I... I don't think I'm ready for that.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
You don't have to decide right now. But I think your story - the story of someone who recognized they needed to change and actually did it - could be really powerful for other students.

**DOXY**
What would I say?

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
The truth. Your truth.

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER**

DOXY approaches ETHAN and LILY, looking nervous but determined.

**DOXY**
Can we talk? I need some advice.

They find a quiet spot.

**ETHAN**
What's up?

**DOXY**
Principal Martinez asked me to speak at the next assembly. About my... about my change.

**LILY**
That's amazing! It would be a great opportunity.

**DOXY**
But what if I say the wrong thing? What if people don't believe me? What if I mess up and everyone realizes I'm still the same person inside?

**ETHAN**
The fact that you're worried about that shows you've already changed.

**LILY**
What do you want to say?

**DOXY**
I want to apologize. Not just to Ethan, but to everyone I hurt. And I want to tell them that it's possible to change, even when it seems impossible.

**ETHAN**
Then that's what you say.

**DOXY**
But what if no one wants to hear from me? What if they just see me as the guy who used to be a bully?

**LILY**
Then you show them through your actions that you've changed, and your words will follow naturally.

**DOXY**
This is terrifying.

**ETHAN**
I know. But speaking in front of the school was terrifying too, and you saw how that turned out.

DOXY considers this, then nods with growing determination.

**DOXY**
Okay. I'll do it.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

### **SCENE 12: THE SPEECH (20 minutes)**

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY**

Another full assembly, similar to the first but with a different energy. Students are more engaged, more aware. The stage setup is similar, but this time DOXY will be speaking, not just listening.

PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ approaches the microphone.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
Good morning, Westview High. Six months ago, we held an assembly about bullying. Today, we want to talk about something equally important - transformation and the possibility of change.

The audience listens intently.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ (CONT'D)**
Today, we have a student who wants to share his own story of growth and change. Sometimes, the people who seem to be causing problems are dealing with their own issues, and sometimes, they can surprise us with their capacity for growth.

DOXY takes a deep breath and approaches the microphone. He looks out at the audience, recognizing faces - some friendly, some skeptical, some curious.

**DOXY**
Hi. I'm Doxy.

A moment of silence. Even his voice sounds different - more genuine, less defensive.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
Six months ago, I was the person others were afraid of. I was someone who used their voice to hurt people instead of help them. I was someone who thought being tough meant making other people feel small.

DOXY pauses, making eye contact with various students in the audience.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
But today, I want to be someone who uses their voice to make our school a better place for everyone. And I want to tell you how that happened.

He looks directly at ETHAN in the audience.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
Six months ago, a brave student named Ethan stood up in this very room and told us about his experience with bullying. At the time, I thought it was just another assembly. I thought it didn't apply to me.

The audience is completely silent now. Even the air conditioning seems quieter.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
But Ethan's words stuck with me. He talked about fear, about feeling invisible, about wondering if anyone cared. And I realized... I realized that I had been the cause of that fear for Ethan. And for other people too.

DOXY's voice becomes quieter, more vulnerable.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
That was the first time I really thought about how my actions affected other people. Before that, I was so focused on not looking weak, on fitting in, on making sure people knew I wasn't someone to mess with, that I became the person everyone actually needed protection from.

He looks at LILY in the audience.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
A friend helped me see that real strength isn't about making others feel weak. Real strength is using your power to help people, to protect them, to build them up.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
I'm not telling you this because I want you to feel sorry for me. I'm telling you this because I want you to know that change is possible. Even for someone like me, who had been mean for so long that it felt like part of my identity.

His voice grows stronger.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
To anyone who has ever been afraid to come to school, to anyone who has ever felt invisible or worthless - you matter. You belong here. And you are not alone.

He pauses, looking out at the audience.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
And to anyone who might be struggling with their own anger or pain, who might be taking it out on others - I want you to know that you can change too. It won't be easy. It will take time, and effort, and sometimes people won't believe in you. But it's possible.

DOXY's voice becomes more personal.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
To Ethan - thank you for having the courage to speak up. Thank you for giving me the chance to become better. And thank you for believing that people can change, even when they don't deserve that belief.

ETHAN nods slightly, clearly moved.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
To everyone in this school - we all have the power to make this a better place. We all have the choice to use our voices to help, not hurt. And we all deserve to feel safe, valued, and respected here.

APPLAUSE fills the auditorium, but this time it feels different - more genuine, more hopeful.

**DOXY (CONT'D)**
We can all be the change we want to see. Thank you.

DOXY walks back to his seat, and ETHAN is the first to reach out and shake his hand. LILY follows. The applause continues, and gradually becomes a standing ovation.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

### **SCENE 13: EXTENDED RESOLUTION - TIME JUMP MONTAGE (25 minutes)**

**MONTAGE - "ONE YEAR LATER"**

**EXT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - AERIAL SHOT - MORNING**

A year later, the same drone shot of Westview High School, but the atmosphere is completely different. Students are walking together, clearly comfortable with each other. The camera descends to show groups of students of all backgrounds interacting positively.

**VOICEOVER (ETHAN)**
*(mature, confident)*
A year ago, I never thought someone like Doxy could change. But I learned that people are more complex than we give them credit for.

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS**

The same hallway where DOXY once bullied ETHAN, but now DOXY walks with a diverse group of students, including some who used to be his targets. They're laughing and talking naturally.

**VOICEOVER (ETHAN)**
*(continuing)*
And sometimes, all it takes is someone believing in you. Or several someones.

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - CANTEEN - LUNCH**

The canteen now has integrated seating. DOXY, ETHAN, LILY, and MARIA (the new student) sit together, discussing homework and weekend plans. The conversation is natural and friendly.

**DOXY**
*(to the group)*
So, who's ready for the history test tomorrow?

**MARIA**
I am! Thanks to your study group, Doxy.

**DOXY**
We all help each other. That's what we're supposed to do.

**ETHAN**
Remember when you used to think helping people made you weak?

**DOXY**
(laughing)
I was pretty stupid back then.

**LILY**
You were young and dealing with your own stuff. Growing up is learning to be better.

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY**

A new student, TOMMY (14), sits alone and looking lost. Another student, JAKE (15), who used to be one of DOXY's old friends, approaches him.

**JAKE**
Hey, you new here? I'm Jake. Need help finding your classes?

**TOMMY**
(grateful)
Yeah, that would be awesome. I'm Tommy.

They walk out together. The camera shows this interaction to demonstrate how the culture of the school has changed.

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ and MS. JOHNSON review reports.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
The bullying incidents have decreased by 60% this year.

**MS. JOHNSON**
And we're seeing increased reporting, which means students feel safer coming forward.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
It seems like Ethan and Doxy's speeches really made a difference.

**MS. JOHNSON**
It wasn't just their speeches. It was their commitment to change. And the students seeing that real change is possible.

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - AFTERNOON**

DOXY, ETHAN, LILY, and MARIA are studying together. DOXY is helping MARIA with her history homework while ETHAN works on a science project and LILY reads for English class.

**MARIA**
Doxy, I still can't believe how much you've changed. You helped me so much when I was new, and now I know you help everyone.

**DOXY**
I just learned that being kind is much better than being mean. It makes you feel good about yourself.

**ETHAN**
And it makes everyone around you feel good too.

**LILY**
That's what community looks like.

**EXT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON**

A football practice is in progress, but the focus is on teamwork and support rather than just winning. DOXY is on the team, and he's encouraging a struggling player instead of mocking him.

**DOXY**
Come on, man. You'll get it. We all start somewhere.

**PLAYER**
Thanks, Doxy. You're way different than I heard you were.

**DOXY**
People can surprise you if you give them the chance to grow.

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - ASSEMBLY HALL - EVENING**

The same assembly hall is set up for a special presentation. Students, parents, and community members gather. A banner reads: "Westview High School - A Place Where Everyone Belongs."

PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ takes the microphone.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ**
Tonight, we want to recognize the students who have shown exceptional growth and community building this year.

She calls up several students, including DOXY, ETHAN, and LILY.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ (CONT'D)**
These students have demonstrated that our school is more than just a place to learn facts - it's a place to learn about being human.

DOXY steps forward to receive his award. The audience applauds, and DOXY looks genuinely happy rather than uncomfortable with attention.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ (CONT'D)**
Ethan, your courage in speaking up inspired not just your peers, but our entire community.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ (CONT'D)**
Lily, your compassion and leadership have helped create the environment where change could happen.

**PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ (CONT'D)**
And Doxy, your transformation proves that anyone can become the person they want to be, with effort, support, and genuine commitment to growth.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

### **SCENE 14: FINALE - "THANK YOU, WESTVIEW!" (5 minutes)**

**INT. WESTVIEW HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY (FINAL DAY OF SCHOOL YEAR)**

The school is buzzing with end-of-year energy. Students are happy, energetic, and clearly bonded with each other. DOXY, ETHAN, and LILY walk together toward their lockers.

**DOXY**
I can't believe how different everything feels from last year.

**ETHAN**
It doesn't feel real sometimes. Like, we actually did it.

**LILY**
You mean we all became better people?

**DOXY**
I mean, I became a better person. You two were already pretty awesome.

**ETHAN**
We all were dealing with our own stuff. You just had a bigger adjustment to make.

**DOXY**
Still. Thank you. Both of you. For not giving up on me.

**LILY**
That's what friends do.

**ETHAN**
And thank you for proving that people really can change.

They reach the exit doors. Outside, parents are waiting to pick up their children. The parking lot is full of cars, and there's a sense of completion and accomplishment in the air.

**DOXY**
So, what are you guys doing for the summer?

**LILY**
Working at a camp for kids. Teaching them about teamwork and kindness.

**ETHAN**
Interning at the local bookstore. Reading as much as possible.

**DOXY**
That sounds perfect for both of you.

**ETHAN**
What about you?

**DOXY**
Thinking about becoming a mentor for younger kids. You know, someone who can help them figure out how to handle their emotions without taking it out on other people.

**LILY**
That's a great idea. You'd be good at that.

**DOXY**
Maybe. I just want to help prevent some of the pain I caused.

They step outside into the bright sunlight. The camera pulls back to show the three friends walking toward their respective parents' cars, but pausing to hug each other goodbye.

**VOICEOVER (DOXY)**
A year ago, I thought I knew who I was. I thought being tough meant being mean, and I thought fitting in required making others feel small.

The camera continues to pull back, showing the entire school.

**VOICEOVER (DOXY) (CONT'D)**
But Westview taught me that real strength comes from building people up, not tearing them down. And that everyone deserves to feel safe, valued, and respected.

The camera rises above the school, showing the entire campus.

**VOICEOVER (DOXY) (CONT'D)**
Some of the best things about school aren't the things you can measure on tests. They're the people you meet, the friendships you form, and the person you become because of those relationships.

**FADE TO WHITE**

**TEXT ON SCREEN: "Thank you, Westview!"**

**VOICEOVER (ALL THREE)**
(overlapping)
Thank you, Westview.
